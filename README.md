# Chemprop-learning
A repository for learning about Chemprop machine learning of molecules and reactions.

## Papers:

1. [Machine Learning of Reaction Properties via Learned Representations of the Condensed Graph of Reaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00975)

This paper describes how directed message passing neural networks can be used to predict reaction properties.  This is achieved by representing reactions as molecular graphs, where changes in substrate and product composition, as well as the alterations in bonds, are encoded in the graph architecture of the model.  Seven open-source reaction databases were used to predict parameters such as reaction rates and enthalpies of reaction.  

2. [Analyzing Learned Molecular Representations for Property Prediction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00237)

This paper described the Chemprop python package which implements Directed message passing neural networks to predict molecular properties.
